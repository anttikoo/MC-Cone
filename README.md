MC-Cone - Manual Cell Counter

This is a software for counting cells or any particles from digital images (jpg, png, gif, tif). 

Main idea:
Precount cell with automatic cell counting and then fulfill the countings manually.

Images and markings are shown as layers:
Several images with same resolution can be imported simultaneously and markings of different images can be compared.

Grid:
Divide the image the smaller parts and count only some of them. 
Program scales the counting by area of selected and the area of the whole image.

Saving:
Save marking to xml-file for later counting.

Export:
Export results as text, images and set of images
